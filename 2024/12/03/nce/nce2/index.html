<p><strong>Why did the writer complain to the people behind him?</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. ‘I can’t hear a word!’ I said angrily. ‘It’s none of your business,’ the young man said rudely. ‘This is a private conversation!’</p>

<p>At last firemen have put out a big forest fire in California. Since then, they have been trying<br>to find out how the fire began. Forest fires are often caused by broken glass or by cigarette ends<br>which people carelessly throw away. Yesterday the firemen examined the ground carefully, but<br>were not able to find any broken glass. They were also quite sure that a cigarette end did not start<br>the fire. This morning, however, a firemen accidentally discovered the cause. He noticed the<br>remains of a snake which was wound round the electric wires of a 16,000-volt power line. In this<br>way, he was able to solve the mystery. The explanation was simple but very unusual. A bird had<br>snatched up the snake from the ground and then dropped it on to the wires. The snake then wound<br>itself round the wires. When it did so, it sent sparks down to the ground and these immediately<br>started a fire.</p>

Dreams of finding lost treasure almost came true recently. A new machine called ‘The<br>Revealer’ has been invented and it has been used to detect gold which has been buried in the<br>ground. The machine was used in a cave near the seashore where – it is said – pirates used to hide<br>gold. The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to collect it. Armed with the new<br>machine, a search party went into the cave hoping to find buried treasure. The leader of the party<br>was examining the soil near the entrance to the cave when the machine showed that there was gold<br>under the ground. Very excited, the party dug a hole two feel deep. They finally found a small gold<br>coin which was almost worthless. The party then searched the whole cave thoroughly but did not<br>find anything except an empty tin trunk.

<p>First listen and then answer the question.<br>听录音，然后回答以下问题。<br>Why was the first tunnel not completed?</p>
<p>In 1858, a French engineer, Aime Thome de Gamond, arrived in England with a plan for a<br>twenty-one-mile tunnel under the English Channel. He said that it would be possible to build a<br>platform in the centre of the Channel. This platform would serve as a port and a railway station.<br>The tunnel would be well-ventilated if tall chimneys were built above sea level. In 1860, a better<br>plan was put forward by an Englishman, William Low. He suggested that a double railway-tunnel<br>should be built. This would solve the problem of ventilation, for if a train entered this tunnel, it<br>would draw in fresh air behind it. Forty-two years later a tunnel was actually begun. If, at the time,<br>the British had not feared invasion, it would have been completed. The world had to wait almost<br>another 100 years for the Channel Tunnel. It was officially opened on March 7,1994, finally<br>connecting Britain to the European continent.</p>

<p>In 1963 a Lancaster bomber crashed on Wallis Island, a remote place in the South Pacific, a<br>long way west of Samoa.

Then in 1989, twenty-six years after the crash, the<br>plane was accidentally rediscovered in an aerial survey of the island. By this time, a Lancaster<br>bomber in reasonable condition was rare and worth rescuing. The French authorities had the plane<br>packaged and moved in parts back to France. Now a group of enthusiasts are going to have the<br>plane restored. It has four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, but the group will need to have only three<br>of them rebuilt.

<p>Haroun Tazieff, the Polish scientist, has spent his lifetime studying active volcanoes and deep<br>caves in all parts of the world. In 1948, he went to Lake Kivu in the Congo to observe a new<br>volcano which he later named Kituro. Tazieff was able to set up his camp very close to the<br>volcano while it was erupting violently. Though he managed to take a number of brilliant<br>photographs, he could not stay near the volcano for very long. He noticed that a river of liquid<br>rock was coming towards him. It threatened to surround him completely, but Tazieff managed to<br>escape just in time. He waited until the volcano became quiet and he was able to return two days<br>later. This time, he managed to climb into the mouth of Kituro so that he could take photographs<br>and measure temperatures. Tazieff has often risked his life in this way.

<p>When a light passenger plane flew off course some time ago, it crashed in the mountains and<br>its pilot was killed. The only passengers, a young woman and her two baby daughters, were unhurt.<br>It was the middle of winter. Snow lay thick on the ground. The woman knew that the nearest<br>village was miles away. When it grew dark, she turned a suitcase into a bed and put the children<br>inside it, covering them with all the clothes she could find. During the night, it got terribly cold.<br>The woman kept as near as she could to the children and even tried to get into the case herself, but<br>it was too small. Early next morning, she heard planes passing overhead and wondered how she<br>could send a signal. Then she had an idea. She stamped out the letters ‘SOS’ in the snow.<br>Fortunately, a pilot saw the signal and sent a message by radio to the nearest town. It was not long<br>before a helicopter arrived on the scene to rescue the survivors of the plane crash.</p>

<p>The mummy of an Egyptian woman who died in 800 B.C. has just had an operation. The<br>mummy is that of Shepenmut who was once a singer in the Temple of Thebes. As there were<br>strange marks on the X-ray plates taken of the mummy, doctors have been trying to find out<br>whether the woman died of a rare disease. The only way to do this was to operate. The operation,<br>which lasted for over four hours, proved to be very difficult because of the hard resin which<br>covered the skin. The doctors removed a section of the mummy and sent it to a laboratory. They<br>also found something which the X-ray plates did not show: a small wax figure of the god<br>Duamutef. This god which has the head of a cow was normally placed inside a mummy. The<br>doctors have not yet decided how the woman died. They feared that the mummy would fall to<br>pieces when they cut it open, but fortunately this has not happened. The mummy successfully<br>survived the operation.</p>

<p>Fishermen and sailors sometimes claim to have seen monsters in the sea. Though people have<br>often laughed at stories told by seamen, it is now known that many of these ‘monsters’ which have<br>at times been sighted are simply strange fish. Occasionally, unusual creatures are washed to the<br>shore, but they are rarely caught out at sea. Some time ago, however, a peculiar fish was caught<br>near Madagascar. A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it<br>pulled on the line. Realizing that this was no ordinary fish, the fisherman made every effort not to<br>damage it in any way. When it was eventually brought to shore, it was found to be over thirteen<br>feet long. It had a head like a horse, big blue eyes, shining silver skin, and a bright red tail. The<br>fish, which has since been sent to a museum where it is being examined by a scientist, is called an<br>oarfish.

In<br>less than a minute, it roared past them only a few feet away. After it had passed, they swam on as<br>quickly as they could because they knew that the boat would soon return. They had just had<br>enough time to swim out of danger when the boat again completed a circle. On this occasion,<br>however, it had slowed down considerably. The petrol had nearly all been used up.

The fish are not sharks or killer whales, but favourite eating<br>varieties like cod and skate which grow to unnatural sizes, sometimes as much as twelve feet in<br>length. Three factors have caused these fish to grow so large: the warm water round the hot oil<br>pipes under the sea; the plentiful supply of food thrown overboard by the crews on the rigs; the<br>total absence of fishing boats around the oil rigs.

The great statue,<br>which was designed by the sculptor Auguste Bartholdi, took ten years to complete.

Before it could be transported to the United States, a site had to be found for it and a<br>pedestal had to be built. The site chosen was an island at the entrance of New York Harbour. By<br>1884, a statue which was 151 feet tall had been erected in Paris. The following year, it was taken<br>to pieces and sent to America. By the end of October 1886, the statue had been put together again<br>and it was officially presented to the American people by Bartholdi.

As they<br>are expected to be hungry after their long journey, food is laid out for them. Specially-made<br>lanterns are hung outside each house to help the dead to find their way. All night long, people<br>dance and sing. In the early morning, the food that had been laid out for the dead is thrown into a<br>river or into the sea as it is considered unlucky for anyone living to eat it. In towns that are near<br>the sea, the tiny lanterns which had been hung in the streets the night before, are placed into the<br>water when the festival is over. Thousands of lanterns slowly drift out to sea guiding the dead on<br>their return journey to the other world.

<p>festival  n. 节日<br>lantern  n. 灯笼<br>spectacle<br>n. 景象，壮观，场面<br>参考译文<br>日本每年过一次“亡灵节”。这个节日是个欢乐的日子，因为在这一天，据说死去的人<br>要回到他们的家里来，活着的人则对他们表示欢迎。因为预料到他们在经过长途旅行之后会<br>感到饥饿，所以为他们摆放好了食品。特制的灯笼挂在各家的门外，为的是帮助亡灵看清道<br>路。整个夜晚人们载歌载舞。一大早，人们便把为死者摆放的食品扔进河中或海里，因为人<br>们认为活着的人吃了这些东西是不吉利的。在靠海的城镇中，头天夜里挂在大街小巷的小灯<br>笼在节后就放在了水里。成千上万只灯笼慢慢漂向大海，指引着亡灵返回另一个世界。这是<br>一个感人的场面，人们成群地伫立在海岸上，注视着灯笼远去，直到再也看不见为止。</p>
